dtbook-css is a modular and extensible layout framework for DTBooks. dtbook-css is intended to be used both as the stylesheet for the end product and within the production toolchain.

dtbook-css is compatible with (at least) Oxygen XML editor (especially so when augmented with [dtBookTools](https://github.com/jukkae/dtBookTools)), Dolphin EasyReader / Internet Explorer 7, and modern WebKit/Gecko/Trident-based browsers. Modern browser support is not widely tested. There is preliminary support for mobile devices, but mobile support is not yet satisfactory.

dtbook-css is meant to be a long-term, one size fits all-type of solution for rapid production of DTBook.

## Usage

If you're just interested in using the CSS as is, download [dtbook.css](https://github.com/jukkae/dtbook-css/raw/master/dtbook.css).

## Downloading

If you want to edit the CSS, you can download the project as a [zip](https://github.com/jukkae/dtbook-css/archive/master.zip).

## Building

The easiest way for users to build the project is probably with Sublime Text's sass-textmate-bundle.

### Build system installation

1. Install [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2).
2. Install Ruby. Download [Ruby for Windows](rubyinstaller.org/downloads) and install as Executable in PATH.
3. Install SASS. Open Start menu and type `cmd` and press enter. Type `gem install sass` and press enter.
4. Install [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) for Sublime Text.
5. Install SASS textmate bundle with Package Control. Click `Preferences` -> `Package Control` -> `Install Package` -> Type `sass` -> click on `Sass`. The description text is "Sass support for TextMate & Sublime Text (2 & 3)".
6. Install SASS Build with Package Control.
7. Restart Sublime Text.

### Building

1. Open dtbook.scss in Sublime Text.
2. `Tools` -> `Build` or `ctrl + B`

This builds the whole project into `dtbook.css` file in the same folder as `dtbook.scss`.

## Editing

The project is structured modularly. `dtbook.scss` is the main SASS project file that a) contains namespace declarations and b) imports all other files. `globals` folder contains a reset sheet, global variable definitions (for example, color scheming, fonts, margin and padding sizes and so on), global mixins (rounded corners) and so on. `globals` folder has no concrete declarations for any particular elements or classes. `oxygen` folder contains code required for Oxygen XML Editor author mode. `elements` folder contains concrete style rules for elements and some reusable templates bound to classes (see for example `_laatikko.scss`). Note that in concrete style rules the convention is to avoid usage of naked values (e.g. a particular color such as `#FFAAAA` or manually setting `margin: 2em;`). All such values shall be defined under `globals` and then reused by variable name. This helps to keep the code manageable and understandable, reduces code duplication and makes it possible to make big changes fast.
